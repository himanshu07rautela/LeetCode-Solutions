# Himanshu's C++ Solutions Repository

Welcome to my personal repository where I store my solutions to programming problems! Here, you'll find my solutions to various coding challenges that I've tackled since July 16, 2024.

## About

This repository is organized by problem categories and platforms. Each problem solution includes a detailed explanation of the approach, complexity analysis, and the C++ code implementation.

## Purpose

I created this repository to:
- Document my problem-solving journey.
- Showcase my skills and understanding of algorithms and data structures.
- Provide a resource for others to learn and gain insights into different problem-solving techniques.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:
- **LeetCode**: Solutions to problems from LeetCode.
- **Geeksforgeeks**: Solutions from other Geeksforgeeks.

Each problem folder contains:
- `README.md`: Explanation of the problem, approach, and complexity analysis.
- `solution.cpp`: C++ implementation of the solution.

## Usage

Feel free to explore, learn, and provide feedback on any of the solutions! If you find these solutions helpful or have suggestions for improvement, please let me know.
